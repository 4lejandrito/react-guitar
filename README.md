### Props

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `className`    | A CSS class string to apply to the container element.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `strings`      | An array where each number represents the fret the string is pressed on (`0` means open string and `-1` muted). `[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, -1]` is an `A minor` in a standard guitar and `[3, 0, 0, 0]` is a `C major` in a ukelele.                |
| `frets`        | An object with the shape `{ from: number amount: number }` to configure the frets of the guitar (`{ from: 0, amount: 22 }` by default). It can start on any fret which is useful for displaying just a chord instead of the whole guitar. |
| `lefty`        | A boolean to configure the guitar for left handed people like me.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `center`       | A boolean to indicate if the current fretting should be centered. If set to `true` the guitar horizontal scroll will be set so that the middle fret is centered.                                                                          |
| `renderFinger` | A function `(string: number, fret: number) => JSX.Element` that will be used to render the content of the white bubble used for the fingers. This can be used to render the note name.                                                    |
| `theme`        | A theme object to customise the guitar look and feel. See [Theming](#theming).                                                                                                                                                            |
| `playOnHover`  | A boolean to indicate if hovering with the mouse should trigger play events.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `onChange`     | A function `(strings: number[]) => void` that will be called when a string is press/unpressed. If not present the guitar will be read only.                                                                                               |
| `onPlay`       | A function `(string: number) => void` that will be called each time the user plays a string (hovering with the mouse). This can be used to play the sound of the string.                                                                  |

### Hooks

#### useSound

In order to enable sound playing `react-guitar` offers the [useSound](packages/react-guitar/src/hooks/sound.ts) hook:

```jsx
import Guitar, { useSound } from 'react-guitar'
import E2 from 'react-guitar/resources/E2.mp3'
import D3 from 'react-guitar/resources/D3.mp3'
import G3 from 'react-guitar/resources/G3.mp3'
import E4 from 'react-guitar/resources/E4.mp3'

...

const { play, strum } = useSound({ E2, D3, G3, E4 }, strings, tuning)

<Guitar strings={strings} onPlay={play}/>

...
```

It receives:
| Name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `samples` | A map from note names to mp3 files representing the samples. `react-guitar` offers 4 samples out of the box recorded from a Spanish guitar. |
| `strings` | The same value passed as the `strings` prop to the `<Guitar />` component with the current fretting. |
| `tuning` | An array of midi values for each string. `react-guitar` offers 4 tunings out of the box (`standard`, `ukelele`, `rondeÃ±a` and `dadgad`). |

And will return an object containing:

| Name    | Description                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `play`  | A function that receives a string number and plays its current sound. |
| `strum` | A function that will strum all the strings of the guitar.             |

### Theming

`react-guitar` look and feel can be customised by passing the `theme` prop. A theme is an object describing the customisable properties of the guitar:

```tsx
{
  description: string // for screen readers
  color: string
  nut: { color: string }
  fret: {
    color: string
    separator: {
      color: string
      radius?: boolean
      shadow?: boolean
      width?: 'sm' | 'md'
    }
    marker?: (fret: number) => JSX.Element | null
    counter: { color: string }
  }
  string: { color: (string: number) => string }
  finger: { text: { color: string }; color: string }
}
```

See https://react-guitar.com/storybook/?path=/story/guitar--theming for an in teractive example.

By default the guitar is styled as a Spanish guitar but some other themes are available:

- [react-guitar-theme-dark](packages/react-guitar-theme-dark): A dark theme.
- [react-guitar-theme-coco](packages/react-guitar-theme-coco): A theme for the guitar from the [Coco](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)>) film.

## Developing

- `yarn build` will build the component and the site, this is mandatory the first time you clone the repo.
- `yarn start` will spin up the storybook and the site and all the packages in watch mode.
